**Demo: https://joe-software.github.io/chart-component/**

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React JS

This product was built using React.JS.

## Optimizations

If I had more time to further develop this product I would include a method of authentication and allow users to save their budget data over a number of weeks, allowing longer term planning. 

## Lessons Learned:

Using tried and tested colour schemes can be effecient and effective, rather than trying to create one from scratch.
